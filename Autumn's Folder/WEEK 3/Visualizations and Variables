Week 3: Exploratory Analysis

From the Introductory Video:
“Exploratory data analysis is a time to investigate suspicions, create simple visuals, and generally play around with the data to better understand it. 
Evaluation questions may change slightly, and exploratory data analysis can help guide those changes as they happen. You may want to use Tableau for some/all of exploration as data can easily be manipulated there.”

Exploratory Models Already Completed in Week 2:
o	Boxplots- looking for outliers
o	Correlation Matrix
o	Scatter/Normal Probability Plots

Data Exploration by Data Type
    Categorical Data (quality)
        Pie chart: single categorical variable
        Bar graph: single categorical variable
        Stacked bar graph: two or more categorical variables
    
    Continuous Data (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugars, chlorides, sulphates, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, pH, density, alcohol)
        Histogram: single quantitative variable
        Boxplot: single quantitative variable
        Scatterplot: two quantitative variables
        Line graph: two quantitative variables, one of which is time or distance

    Categorical and Continuous Data
        Histogram with multiple groups
        Side-by-side boxplots: one quantitative variable + one categorical variable with one categorical variable with two or more groups
        Tree map: one quantitative + one or more categorical variables
        Heat map: one (+) quantitative variable + one or more categorical variables
