Wine Terms (Columns)

    General Info: Acids > major constituents, contribute greatly to its taste. 
    Acid sourness/tartness is a fundamental feature in wine taste.  Wines lacking in acid are "flat."  
    
    Chemically the acids influence titrable acidity> affects taste and pH which affects color, stability to oxidation, and lifespan of the wine.   
    
    Total acidity is divided into two groups :volatile acids and fixed acids.

    Fixed Acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
    
        Fixed acids found in wines: tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic.
        Ratios: 1,000 to 4,000 mg/L tartaric acid, 0 to 8,000 mg/L malic acid, 0 to 500 mg/L citric acid, and 500 to 2,000 mg/L succinic acid.
    
        Origin: all in grapes but succinic; succinic develops during fermentation

        Taste Variation: Wines from cool climate grapes: high in acidity,taste sour. 
          Wines from warm climate grapes can be low in acid, increasing acidity can help flatness.

    Volatile Acidity: amount of acetic acid in wine
    
        Steam distillable acids in wine: primarily acetic acid, also lactic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids.   
    
        Average Levels: Acetic acid  <400 mg/L in a new,dry table wine, typical levels from undetectable to 3g/L.

        U.S. legal limits of Volatile Acidity: 
            Red Table Wine 1.2 g/L
            White Table Wine 1.1 g/L
        
        Aroma Threshold Acetic Acid:  Red wine from 600 mg/L and 900 mg/L. Acetic acid is generally considered a spoilage product (vinegar), but some winemakers seek a low or barely detectible level of acetic acid to add to the perceived complexity of a wine.

    Citric Acid Content: Citric acid is a weak organic acid, used as a preservative or additive (add sour taste)

        Properties: Elicits antimicrobial activity on molds and bacteria. It may create a relationship with antioxidants by chelating metal ions to prevent browning.

        In winemaking, the citric-sugar co-metabolism can also increase the formation of volatile acid in wine which can affect the wine aroma negatively if present at excessive levels.

        Citric acid is often added to wines to increase acidity, complement a flavor, or give a fresh flavor. 
        
        Disadvantages: Disadvantage of adding citric acid is its microbial instability. Bacteria use citric acid in their metabolism, it may increase the growth of unwanted microbes. To increase acidity of wine, most winemakers will add tartaric acid instead.

    Residual Sugar Content: The sugars left unfermented in a finished wine (measured in grams per liter)
    Rare to find wines with <1 g/L

        Labeling terms, still wines in the EU:
        Up to 4 g/l---      Dry
        4 g/l – 12 g/l---   Medium dry 
        12 g/l – 45 g/l---  Medium (Medium sweet)
        More than 45 g/l--- Sweet

    Chlorides: Amount of sodium choride present in wine (mg/L)
        Generally relatable to the salinity of the soil.

        Lowest maximum legal threshhold for chloride ions is 364 mg/L, (sodium chloride as a compound 600 mg/L) 
        Not dectectable in white wine until 570 mg/L
        Not detectable in red wine until 520 mg/L

        Note to self: Highest chloride value in our dataset is .611

    Free Sulfur Dioxide (FS02): free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion

        FS02 and the pH determine how much sulfur dioxide is available to protect the wine from oxidation.  
        
        Too much FSO2 can be perceptible to consumers, masking the wine’s aromas and inhibiting its ability  breathe. In high enough concentrations, contributing a sharp/metallic/bitter flavor or sensation.

        FSO2 is more important for the overall protection of the wine, vs. Total Sulfur Dioxide

    Total Sulfur Dioxide (S02): The SO2 that is free in the wine (+) portion that is bound to other chemicals in the wine.

    Density: The density of wine juice is higher than water, it is thicker. The typical density of wine juice (before yeast reactions) is generally between 1.080 and 1.090 (8-9% more dense than water).

    Alcohol is less dense that water, approximately 0.8, or 20% less dense. 
    Aas the yeast consumes the sugar in the wine, and converts it to alcohol, the liquid is less dense. 
    After fermentation, the specific gravity of wine should be slightly less than 1.00, usually 0.996.

    pH: overall ranges on a scale from 0 -14, 0 being the most acidic, 7 being neutral, 14 being the most basic
    
        pH level of a wine typically ranges from 3 to 4.

        Color: Red wines with higher acidity >bright ruby color, lower pH gives them a red hue. 
        Higher pH, less-acidic red wines can take on a blue or purple hue or even brown due to oxidation. 
        Oxidation can be a problem regardless of pH, but the reaction occurs quicker at a higher pH.

        Taste: Wine with high acid will usually taste crisper/more tart on the palate. 
        A low-acid wine will feel smoother and rounder on the palate. 
        
        When done carefully, it can be a lovely, but when low acid is combined with high pH, a flabby or almost soapy feeling can be present.

        High acid wines> more likely to improve with time. 
        Stability of high acid/low pH wines helps during aging, but high pH wines are more prone to microbes.
        That is corrected by adding S02. Takes a lot more sulfur dioxide to get the same effect in a wine at pH level of 4 as one with 10 times more acidity at pH level of 3.

        Wines with higher pH require more sulfites to protect them from oxidation.

    Sulphates: Sulfates are salts of sulfuric acid. 

        Sulfates aren’t involved in wine production, but some beer makers use calcium sulfate—also known as brewers’ gypsum—to correct mineral deficiencies in water during the brewing process.
        ????Should this column really be labeled 'sulphates' then or 'sulfites'????

        Wines in the United States are allowed to contain up to 350 parts per million (ppm) sulfites, but any wine with more than 10 ppm requires labeling. 

        White wines: more sulfites, no skin contact during fermentation. 
        
        Red wines: color from extended contact with grape skins during fermentation. Grape skins contain tannins, polyphenols, and a variety of other antioxidants that keep wine from spoiling, and as a result, red wines typically don’t need as many added sulfites to stay fresh.
