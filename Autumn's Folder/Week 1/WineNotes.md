Wine Terms (Columns)

    General Info: Acids > major constituents, contribute greatly to its taste. 
    Acid sourness/tartness is a fundamental feature in wine taste.  Wines lacking in acid are "flat."  
    
    Chemically the acids influence titrable acidity> affects taste and pH which affects color, stability to oxidation, and lifespan of the wine.   
    
    Total acidity is divided into two groups :volatile acids and fixed acids.

    Fixed Acidity: Fixed acids found in wines: tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic.
        Ratios: 1,000 to 4,000 mg/L tartaric acid, 0 to 8,000 mg/L malic acid, 0 to 500 mg/L citric acid, and 500 to 2,000 mg/L succinic acid.
    
        Origin: all in grapes but succinic; succinic develops during fermentation

        Taste Variation: Wines from cool climate grapes: high in acidity,taste sour. 
          Wines from warm climate grapes can be low in acid, increasing acidity can help flatness.

    Volatile Acidity: Steam distillable acids in wine: primarily acetic acid, also lactic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids.   
    
        Average Levels: Acetic acid  <400 mg/L in a new,dry table wine, typical levels from undetectable to 3g/L.

        U.S. legal limits of Volatile Acidity: 
            Red Table Wine 1.2 g/L
            White Table Wine 1.1 g/L
        
        Aroma Threshold Acetic Acid:  Red wine from 600 mg/L and 900 mg/L. Acetic acid is generally considered a spoilage product (vinegar), but some winemakers seek a low or barely detectible level of acetic acid to add to the perceived complexity of a wine.

    Citric Acid Content: Citric acid is a weak organic acid, used as a preservative or additive (add sour taste)

        Properties: Elicits antimicrobial activity on molds and bacteria. It may create a relationship with antioxidants by chelating metal ions to prevent browning.

        In winemaking, the citric-sugar co-metabolism can also increase the formation of volatile acid in wine which can affect the wine aroma negatively if present at excessive levels.

        Citric acid is often added to wines to increase acidity, complement a flavor, or give a fresh flavor. 
        
        Disadvantages: Disadvantage of adding citric acid is its microbial instability. Bacteria use citric acid in their metabolism, it may increase the growth of unwanted microbes. To increase acidity of wine, most winemakers will add tartaric acid instead.

    Residual Sugar Content: The sugars left unfermented in a finished wine (measured in grams per liter)

        Labeling terms, still wines in the EU:
        Up to 4 g/l---      Dry
        4 g/l – 12 g/l---   Medium dry 
        12 g/l – 45 g/l---  Medium (Medium sweet)
        More than 45 g/l--- Sweet

    Chlorides: Amount of sodium choride present in wine (mg/L)
        Generally relatable to the salinity of the soil.

        Lowest maximum legal threshhold for chloride ions is 364 mg/L, (sodium chloride as a compound 600 mg/L) 
        Not dectectable in white wine until 570 mg/L
        Not detectable in red wine until 520 mg/L

        Note to self: Highest chloride value in our dataset is .611

    Free Sulfur Dioxide (FS02):

        FS02 and the pH determine how much sulfur dioxide is available to protect the wine from oxidation.  
        
        Too much FSO2 can be perceptible to consumers, masking the wine’s aromas and inhibiting its ability  breathe. In high enough concentrations, contributing a sharp/metallic/bitter flavor or sensation.

        FSO2 is more important for the overall protection of the wine, vs. Total Sulfur Dioxide

    Total Sulfur Dioxide (S02): The SO2 that is free in the wine (+) portion that is bound to other chemicals in the wine.

    Density: The density of wine juice is higher than water, it is thicker. The typical density of wine juice (before yeast reactions) is generally between 1.080 and 1.090 (8-9% more dense than water).

    Alcohol is less dense that water, approximately 0.8, or 20% less dense. 
    Aas the yeast consumes the sugar in the wine, and converts it to alcohol, the liquid is less dense. 
    After fermentation, the specific gravity of wine should be slightly less than 1.00, usually 0.996.
