    General Info: Acids > major constituents, contribute greatly to its taste. 
    Acid sourness/tartness is a fundamental feature in wine taste.  Wines lacking in acid are "flat."  
    
    Chemically the acids influence titrable acidity> affects taste and pH which affects color, stability to oxidation, and lifespan of the wine.   
    
    Total acidity is divided into two groups :volatile acids and fixed acids.

    Fixed Acidity: Fixed acids found in wines: tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic.
       Ratios: 1,000 to 4,000 mg/L tartaric acid, 0 to 8,000 mg/L malic acid, 0 to 500 mg/L citric acid, and 500 to 2,000 mg/L succinic acid.
    
       Origin: all in grapes but succinic; succinic develops during fermentation

       Taste Variation: Wines from cool climate grapes: high in acidity,taste sour. 
          Wines from warm climate grapes can be low in acid, increasing acidity can help flatness.
