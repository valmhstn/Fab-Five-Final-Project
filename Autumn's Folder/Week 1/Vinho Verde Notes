Red and Rosé Vinho Verde

Tasting Notes: Sour Plum, Sour Cherry, Pepper, and Peony

Reds and rosé wines from Vihno Verde ->harder to come by. 
The Minho region (where Vinho Verde comes from) is quite cool and often rainy
    Regioanl wether conditions make it hard to ripen red grapes.


Red Grapes Used:
    Vinhão: (more commonly known as Sousão) is a teinturier grape, and wines are like a spicy, fresh version of Malbec.

    Padeiro (rarer grape) is the project of Amarante region producer Quinta da Raza. 
    Padeiro has such little color, it looks like rosé. It offers up red fruity-juicy notes and ample acidity.
