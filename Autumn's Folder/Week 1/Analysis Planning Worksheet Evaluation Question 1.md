Evaluation Question: Which physiochemical factors are have the most effect on the quality of wine? (determining which features to use in the classification model)


Independent Variable(s):
These variable(s) are causing something or creating an effect. 
List what each is and whether it is categorical or continuous. It is ok to only have one.

    Variable: Fixed Acidity
    □ Continuous 

    Variable: Volatile Acidity
    □ Continuous

    Variable: Citric Acid
    □ Continuous

    Variable: Residual Sugars
    □ Continuous 

    Variable: Free Sulfur Dioxides
    □ Continuous

    Variable: Total Sulfur Dioxide
    □ Continuous

    Variable: Density
    □ Continuous 

    Variable: pH
    □ Continuous

    Variable: Sulphates
    □ Continuous

    Variable: Alcohol
    □ Continuous 



Dependent Variable(s):
These variable(s) are influenced by your independent variable and depend on them. 
List what each is and whether it is categorical or continuous. 
Unless they are related, you should have only one. 

    Variable: Quality of the Wine
    □ Continuous 

    


Now that you know the type and number of independent and dependent variables, you are ready to use the analysis flow charts to choose your analysis!
