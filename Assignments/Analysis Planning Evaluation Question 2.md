Analysis Planning Worksheet

Evaluation Question: 

Having identified the physiochemical properties that influence wine quality, individually, how do they affect the quality? (i.e. does a lower residual sugar content lead to a lower quality score?)


Variables: 

Factors that contribute to wine quality (i.e. derived from stepwise regression analysis in Question 1)


Analysis: 

To answer this evaluation question, we will be using unsuperivsed machine learning via k-Means clustering.
