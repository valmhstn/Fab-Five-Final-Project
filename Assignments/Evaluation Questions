(pulled from slack discussion via Bethel)
Question 1:
Which physiochemical factors are have the most effect on the quality of wine? (determining which features to use in the classification model)

Question 2:
Having determined the factors that contribute to wine quality, individually, how do they affect the quality? 
(i.e. does a lower residual sugar content lead to a lower quality score?)
