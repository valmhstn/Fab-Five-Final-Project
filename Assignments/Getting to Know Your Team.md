### Autumn Heyman:
#### What do you consider your strengths?  
* Data/Statistical Analysis
>Data Wrangling
>Data Visualization (Including Tableau)
>Background Research/Exploration
>Project Presentation, Storyboarding, Editing
>Previous experience writing Research and Business Proposals 

#### What do you consider your weaknesses?  
* Schedule: Outside of my personal schedule, my professional schedule is not a typical or set schedule.  I work a lot of evenings and split/extended shifts, but I will accommodate those committments to meet the needs of this team/project.
>Machine Learning
>Practiced Field/Tech knowledge: I am not new to statistical analysis, but even with what we have gained through Woz-U/ENTITY, I find myself with "tech learning curves" that I need to pick up or improve upon since my professional background does not include any formal "tech training" (GitHub has been an example)
>Team Projects: It's been awhile since I've worked on a "team project" that was of this nature of committment. Most of my projects are solo in nature or things that I start or start with 1 or 2 other people so that they can take the reins and run with something. I am historically a recovering overcommitter and have moved to a more balanced approach in situations where I am able.  I am really grateful to be a part of this team because I have a hard time working in groups that are not committed or unmotivated. I believe we have a strong, well-balanced group, which takes away some of the extra stress I usually put on myself in group situations.

#### How do you feel you work best?  
* Time of day: Personally and professionally, I generally segment out my
day to tackle certain types of tasks and certain times.  
>Analytical, learning, and administrative/writing task type activities I try and tackle before lunch.
>Creative, visual activities, or generative type activities I tackle after lunch.
>Social activities, Zoom calls (outside of work), planning for the next day in the evenings.

•	Type of work: I am up for any of the tasks needed to complete the assignment, there has not been an aspect of data science that I particularly do not enjoy. I enjoy the wrangling and analyzation/discovery process, as well as the writing and composing presentation aspects.

•	Best way to communicate: I’m pretty open and will be clear about the preferred method of communication that will work for me, given a situation.  For the most part, if a team member wants to communicate with me, a Slack message works best to start with.  If I need a face-to-face or quick verbal conversation to work through something, I can make myself available to Zoom/Slack call so we can work through the situation.

#### How do you like to receive feedback?  
* Generally, I like to recieve constructive criticism in writing so I can see where I might need to go back and re-look or re-work something. I may have follow-up questions to gain clarity about or improve something, so written feedback is what I prefer.  If something comes up in a call or meeting though, I'm open to constructive feedback there too.
